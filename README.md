# 312project
This is my python banking application project for COMP 312.

>Mission Statement
The Chicago Bank Account System is a class project developed as a demonstration of open source computing with a focus on (at a practical level) applying python programming techniques, engaged learning, and personal growth. The mission of this project is to create a simple yet functional banking system that showcases the core principles of software development, allowing users to manage their financial transactions effectively. Throughout the course, I continuously strived to improve and build on the program's features based on personal bias and user needs, attempting to build from scratch an accessible and reliable system.

one of the main objectives of this project is to enhance my knowledge of Python programming and gain hands-on experience working in a like real-world application. The project serves as a platform for me to apply the concepts I've taught myself in Python, explore and implement new libraries and tools, and teach myself the iterations that stem within software development.
